                                    SIGN LANGUAGE TRANSLATION TOOL

                                          PURPOSE:  

The goal of sign language translation tools is to help people who are deaf or hard of 
hearing communicate with people who speak spoken languages more often. By translating gestures in sign language into spoken or written language aTITLEnd vice versa, they help, people to communicate.       


                                  TECHNOLOGY USED

MEDIAPIPE – A framework by Google used for real-time hand tracking and landmark detection. It 
            identifies key points on the hand, making it ideal for gesture recognition and 
            human- computer interaction applications.

OPENCV –    A powerful open-source computer vision library used for video capture, frame 
            processing, and image manipulation. It handles tasks like drawing landmarks and 
            managing live video streams.

SCIKIT-LEARN –  A machine learning library used to implement the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 
                classifier, which classifies gestures based on hand landmark features extracted 
                from video frames.

PANDAS   –   A data analysis and manipulation tool used for loading and processing CSV files 
             containing training data (features and labels) used in gesture classification.

Numpy  –     Provides support for fast and efficient numerical operations, especially for 
             handling arrays and performing mathematical operations on feature vectors.

MATPLOTLIB – A plotting library used to visualize data and display gesture recognition results 
             frame by frame in Google Colab, helping users understand the model’s predictions.

GOOGLE COLAB –  A cloud-based platform used to write and run Python code. It allows uploading 
                images or video input, training models, and testing gesture recognition systems 
                without needing local installation



                                      USAGE

Sign language translation tools enable communication between people who use sign language and those who don’t by converting signs into text or speech, and vice versa. These tools promote accessibility and inclusion for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals in various settings, such as education, workplaces, healthcare, and public services.


CONCLUSION  :  An important step toward closing the communication gap between the hearing and 
               non-hearing communities is the Sign Language Translation Tool. The tool 
               facilitates real-time translation of sign language into spoken or written 
               language by utilizing contemporary technologies like computer vision, machine 
               learning, and natural language processing. This promotes accessibility and 
               inclusivity.
